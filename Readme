üëã Hi, I'm @sarathins (Parthasarathi)

Passionate about: Quantitative finance, algorithmic trading, and data-driven decision-making in financial markets.

üå± Currently exploring: Advanced machine learning techniques and momentum-based strategies for enhanced portfolio performance.

üíº Projects:

1 . EPAT Portfolio Optimization with Statistical Arbitrage: 
  Leveraged statistical arbitrage techniques from the EPAT curriculum to optimize portfolios, enhance returns, and minimize risk exposure through systematic analysis.

2. Machine Learning-based Portfolio Management with K-Means Clustering: 
  Applied K-Means clustering for grouping Nifty 50 stocks, with portfolio construction based on maximum Sharpe ratio and equal weights, achieving superior results with Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP).

3. Momentum-Based Intraday Stock Selection with Telegram Bot Integration: 
  Developed and deployed a momentum-scoring system for intraday stock selection, delivering real-time stock lists to clients via a Telegram bot, streamlining market decision-making.

4. MSCI Momentum Index-Based Portfolio Construction:
  Implemented a portfolio construction framework aligned with MSCI Momentum Index methodology, processing stock data, adjusting for corporate actions, calculating momentum scores, 
  and rebalancing portfolios monthly for superior risk-adjusted performance.

5. Options Strategy Projects ‚Äì IV/Greeks Backtesting & Liquidity Filters
  IV & Greeks-Based Backtesting for Index Options:
  Utilized historical implied volatility (IV) and option Greeks (Delta, Theta, Vega)
  to backtest intraday trading strategies on Nifty/Bank Nifty options, analyzing the performance of directional and neutral setups under varying volatility conditions.
  
  Liquidity Screening Tool for Stock Options:
  Developed a filtering system to identify liquid stock option contracts across Nifty 50, using metrics like open interest, volume, bid-ask spread, and impact cost. 
  Designed for intraday and positional trading, ensuring practical execution of strategies with minimal slippage.

6. Momentum Score-Based Portfolio Construction (Upgraded ‚Äì Ongoing Project):
  Independently developed a momentum-based portfolio strategy achieving a Sharpe ratio of 1.06‚Äì1.61, maximum drawdowns of 1.9‚Äì8.6%, and CAGR of 34.4‚Äì46.1% across different stock universes and timeframes.
To enhance performance and reduce risk, upgraded the system using a factor-based framework with PCA for noise reduction and LSTM to capture temporal trends, achieving 84‚Äì90% prediction accuracy with cross-validation scores ranging 0.45‚Äì0.86.
Current tests at the individual stock level demonstrate robust performance with CAGR of 34.4‚Äì46.1%, controlled drawdowns below 9%, and Sharpe ratios consistently exceeding 1.0, supported by LSTM accuracy rates of 84‚Äì90%.
Scope: Expand the strategy to broader stock universes leveraging the proven factor-based model to achieve systematic diversification while maintaining the demonstrated risk-adjusted returns.

ü§ù Looking to collaborate on: Quantitative research, data-driven strategies, algorithmic trading models, and anything that pushes the boundaries of market innovation.
