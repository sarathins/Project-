👋 Hi, I'm @sarathins (Parthasarathi)

Passionate about: Quantitative finance, algorithmic trading, and data-driven decision-making in financial markets.

🌱 Currently exploring: Advanced machine learning techniques and momentum-based strategies for enhanced portfolio performance.

💼 Projects:

1 . EPAT Portfolio Optimization with Statistical Arbitrage: 
Leveraged statistical arbitrage techniques from the EPAT curriculum to optimize portfolios, enhance returns, and minimize risk exposure through systematic analysis.

2. Machine Learning-based Portfolio Management with K-Means Clustering: 
Applied K-Means clustering for grouping Nifty 50 stocks, with portfolio construction based on maximum Sharpe ratio and equal weights, achieving superior results with Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP).

3. Momentum-Based Intraday Stock Selection with Telegram Bot Integration: 
Developed and deployed a momentum-scoring system for intraday stock selection, delivering real-time stock lists to clients via a Telegram bot, streamlining market decision-making.

4. MSCI Momentum Index-Based Portfolio Construction:
Implemented a portfolio construction framework aligned with MSCI Momentum Index methodology, processing stock data, adjusting for corporate actions, calculating momentum scores, 
and rebalancing portfolios monthly for superior risk-adjusted performance.

5. Options Strategy Tools – IV/Greeks and Liquidity Filters
Built tools for index options analysis by extracting and calculating implied volatility (IV) and option Greeks for real-time decision-making in intraday strategies.
Additionally, created a liquidity screening system for identifying liquid contracts across Nifty 50 options, filtering based on OI, volume, bid-ask spreads, and 
impact cost to ensure reliable trade execution in live environments.

6. Momentum Score-Based Portfolio Construction (Upgraded – Ongoing Project):
Independently developed a momentum-based portfolio strategy achieving a Sharpe ratio of 0.8–1.2, 10–15% drawdowns, and 12–20% CAGR depending on the stock universe.
To enhance performance and reduce risk, upgraded the system using a factor-based framework, applying PCA for noise reduction and LSTM to capture temporal trends in price movements.
Current tests at the individual stock level show promising results with CAGR between 50–85%, drawdowns of 10–20%, and a Sharpe ratio consistently above 1.
Scope: Expand the strategy to a broader stock universe to further reduce risk and improve overall returns through systematic diversification.
🤝 Looking to collaborate on: Quantitative research, data-driven strategies, algorithmic trading models, and anything that pushes the boundaries of market innovation.
