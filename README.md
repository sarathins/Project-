## **2. Machine Learning-Based Portfolio Management with K-Means Clustering**
### **Overview**:
This project applies machine learning techniques, specifically K-Means clustering, to construct a portfolio of Nifty 50 stocks, with a focus on outperforming the benchmark index.

### **Key Features**:
- Stock grouping using K-Means clustering for effective diversification.
- Portfolio construction using maximum Sharpe ratio or equal weights.
- Implemented **HRP (Hierarchical Risk Parity)**, which performed better than traditional **MVO (Mean-Variance Optimization)**.
- Comparative performance analysis against the Nifty index.

## **3. MSCI Momentum Index-Based Portfolio Construction**
### **Overview**:
A systematic implementation of the MSCI Momentum Index strategy, focusing on constructing and evaluating a momentum-driven portfolio.

### **Key Features**:
- Processed raw stock data and adjusted for corporate actions.
- Calculated momentum Z-scores based on 6-month and 12-month returns.
- Ranked stocks, selected the top-performing ones, and constructed a value-weighted portfolio.
- Monthly portfolio rebalancing and performance evaluation using metrics like Sharpe Ratio, CAGR, and Maximum Drawdown.

## **4. Intraday Stock Selection with Telegram Bot Integration**
### **Overview**:
This project automates the process of intraday stock selection and real-time updates to a Telegram channel using a bot.

### **Key Features**:
- Automated stock filtering based on volume, price change, and momentum indicators.
- Seamless integration with the Telegram API to send real-time stock recommendations.
- Efficient solution for intraday traders to access actionable insights instantly.
